# Color-tracking-in-ROS2

This program is designed to control the movement of a Pan-Tilt system using color tracking.
It is developed specifically for a Linux 20.04 environment with ROS2 Foxy version and MicroROS.
In terms of hardware, this program utilizes an Arduino Due and a laptop.

*Code in C++*

In this program, I have written the code in C++ language, utilizing the OpenCV library for image processing and implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.

*MicroROS on Arduino*

This program is based on the Arduino platform and has been modified to receive data from two message publishers in ROS2.
